AFR is a software package that includes various routines and tools allowing the
user to reduce, process, and manipulate pulsar data, and create
times-of-arrival compatible with tempo and tempo2 timing software.

Dependencies:
-------------

To use afr, you will need to install:

- cfitsio, a FITS reading and writing library: 
   - on mac OS X, just install using homebrew (along with anything else you 
     are able to install with homebrew!)
   - website: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
- pgplot, for real-time plotting functions:
   - http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/
- clig, a command-line interface and parsing library:
   - http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~geg/clighome/
- tempo, a pulsar timing and data analysis package:
   - http://sourceforge.net/projects/tempo/

Documentation is on its way -- until then, any of the descriptions and
command-line options for a given executable can be found by running it with a
"-h" flag (or any other flag not recognized by the routine).
